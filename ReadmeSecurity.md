Concerns for Securing a Web APP

1)A Pure Client APP(without Server Side Framework Support)
    Short-lived access tokens in memory vs Regular token rotation
    Refresh tokens in secure cookies:Secure token storage practices
    Strong CORS and CSP headers
    XSS prevention

    XSS prevention:
    - Use a Content Security Policy (CSP) to prevent inline scripts and other risky content from being executed.
    - Sanitize and validate all user-supplied input to remove or encode potentially harmful characters.
    - Use a templating engine that automatically escapes variables to prevent XSS.

    Secure token storage:
    - Implement token rotation to minimize the window of exposure if a token is compromised.
    - Consider rotating tokens regularly, even if they are not expired.

    user-supplied input sanitization library list:
    - DOMPurify
    - sanitize-html
    - sanitize-url
    - sanitize-filename
    

2)A Server Side Web APP, you can benifit from the following features
   httpOnly cookies
   Server-side session validation
   CSRF protection
   Secure cookie attributes

3)If you need high security, Use a server-side framework (Next.js, Express, etc.)
   Consider a hybrid approach if possible
